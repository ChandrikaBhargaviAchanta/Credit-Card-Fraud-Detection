# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
_This project aims to enhance security and trust in financial transactions by reducing financial losses and safeguarding customer accounts._  

**Business Problem:** Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions, leading to financial losses and customer distrust due to the rarity of fraudulent transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.  

**Solution:** Built and deployed a predictive model with Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) achieving a 97.93% accuracy that identifies fraudulent transactions in real-time, using techniques like data balancing, feature engineering, and precision-focused evaluation to minimize false positives and negatives.
